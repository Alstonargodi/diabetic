Final year project

Implementation of term frequency-inverse document frequency with Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithm for detecting diabetes early
the main algorithm implements a native way also to measure the performance when it runs on a phone native with low specifications.
The term frequency-inverse document frequency is used for chatbot then Random Forest and Naive Bayes are used to calculate if the user has diabetes or not

noted:
there are some issue especially the performance when start calculating and i made changes to some ui
